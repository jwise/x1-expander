# Assembly instructions for X1Plus Expansion Board

My suggestion for assembling early revisions of the X1Plus Expansion Board
is as follows.  Print [the X1P-800](../x1p-800) parts (four copies of the
clips).  The lower case can be more reliable to drive screws into if printed
from PETG; the clips are also less prone to creep if printed from PETG.  The
upper case is also best printed standing on end.  You will also need varying
lengths of M3 screws.

To assemble:

  * Take the top case and the standoffs, and run M3 screws through them to ensure that they clear (should be a clearance fit).

  * One of the standoffs is differently shaped; it mates with the curved face of the top case.  Line up all four standoffs in place on the top case, using M3 screws to align them.  Use a dab of cyanoacrylate to hold them in place on the top case, so they don't run away when you try to assemble it.

  * Take the bottom case and attach the clips; they should snap in satisfyingly.  The open end of the clips should face left, since that's how it'll slide into the printer.  Once you're sure they attach correctly, use a dab of cyanoacrylate to attach them to the bottom case.  (This isn't entirely necessary but it can save you from being annoyed.)

  * Let the cyanoacrylate cure to avoid frosting your board and/or printer.  Maybe if you prefer, instead of cyanoacrylate, you can use a soldering iron or something to melt the plastic to bond the parts together -- it doesn't have to hold very firmly.

  * Remove the LCD from your printer (remember that you have to press on the bottom of the hinge and slide right).  Disconnect the cable.

  * Connect the harness to your printer.  The white/green connector goes to the camera connector; the other four-pin connector goes to UART; camera goes to the female red/white/green/black connector.

  * Attach the bottom case to your printer front panel.

  * Feed the harness through the front of the printer.  Connect it to the X1P-002-B01 board.

  * Feed the LCD cable through the X1P-002-B01 board and the top case.

  * Line up the X1P-002-B01 board, the bottom case, and top case.  Screw it together.

  * Attach the LCD cable, and then attach the hinge to the front of the top case.

  * Power up your printer.  Hopefully everything works right.
