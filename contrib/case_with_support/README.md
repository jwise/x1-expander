This directory contains an alternative case designed by @liftbag (originally
shown
[here](https://github.com/X1Plus/X1Plus/discussions/445#discussioncomment-12460478)). 

This case offers nicer ergonomics and a more secure way to mount it, in
exchange for the need to print it with supports.  It hasn't been tested with
a real PCBA yet, but if you're willing to print with supports, I encourage
you to give it a try!
